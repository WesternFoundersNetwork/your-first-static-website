                <h2>a.k.a Drake, Drizzy, 6ix God, champagnepapi</h2>
                <p>Born in Toronto on October 24th, 1986, Drake is the son of Sandi and Dennis Graham, a drummer who
                    worked with Jerry Lee Lewis. His father is African American, a native of Memphis, Tennessee and
                    his mother is Jewish Canadian. Drake's interest in performing began at an 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OofNYuXIYo4">early age</a>. From summers
                    spent with his dad in Memphis, he gained an appreciation and understanding for music that would
                    later influence the sound he would create in years to come. Since first being recognized for his
                    role on the highly-successful television series <i>Degrassi: The Next Generation</i>, and going on the
                    road with rap star Lil Wayne after hearing Drake's music in the summer of 2008, Drake has asserted
                    himself as a trailblazer in the creative world. Drake released his mixtape <i>So Far Gone</i> in 2009 and
                    his massive influence in the hip-hop and contemporary music space has commanded the market since,
                    with no end in sight. <b>Drake now holds the record for the most number one hits on <i>Billboard's
                    R&B/Hip-Hop Chart.</i></b></p>
