        <p>Born in Toronto on October 24th, 1986, Drake is the son of Sandi and Dennis Graham, a drummer who worked with Jerry Lee Lewis. Drake's interest in performing began at an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OofNYuXIYo4">early age</a>. From
          summers spent with his dad in Memphis, he gained an appreciation and understanding for music that would later influence the sound he would create in years to come. Since first being recognized for his role on the highly-successful television
          series <i>Degrassi: The Next Generation</i>, and going on the road with rap star Lil Wayne after hearing Drake's music in the summer of 2008, Drake has asserted himself as a trailblazer in the creative world. Drake released his mixtape <i>So Far Gone in 2009</i>         
          and his massive influence in the hip-hop and contemporary music space has commanded the market since, with no end in sight. <b>Drake now holds the record for the most number one hits on <i>Billboard's R&B/Hip-Hop Chart.</i></b></p>
